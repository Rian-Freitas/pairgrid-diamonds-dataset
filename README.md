# Data Visualisation with Seaborn Pairgrid Method

Using the Diamonds dataset, a Seaborn Pairgrid Matrix was developed in order to display:

- The dispersion plot relating two variables of the dataset;
- The histogram showing the distribution of the variable clustered by the variable 'cut';
- The value of the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for the selected pair.
